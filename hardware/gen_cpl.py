"""Export a JLCPCB-format CPL (pick & place) DIRECTLY from the board via pcbnew.

Two structural corrections vs a naive kicad-cli pos export:

1. POSITION = footprint ANCHOR by default; pad bbox CENTER only for the
   footprints listed in POS_PADCENTER.
   Which reference JLCPCB expects depends on the footprint SOURCE (same as the
   rotation issue): easyeda/LCSC footprints were imported from the same source
   as JLCPCB's part, so their ANCHOR is already JLCPCB's placement origin -> use
   anchor (e.g. the XLR J1: anchor 158.07, pad-center 162.46 — pad-center would
   shift it 4.4mm off the holes). KiCad-STANDARD asymmetric footprints (the ESP
   WROOM: anchor at body center, 3.62mm off the pad centroid because the antenna
   side has no pads) need the pad bbox center, since JLCPCB places that part at
   its pad centroid. For all symmetric parts anchor == pad center (no difference).

2. ROTATION = footprint orientation + per-FOOTPRINT correction.
   KiCad's 0-deg reference differs from JLCPCB's pick-place library for KiCad-
   standard footprints. easyeda/LCSC-imported footprints already match JLCPCB
   (their names won't appear in the table -> 0). Keyed by exact footprint name
   so it scales: every part of that package is auto-corrected.

Coords are relative to the board aux origin (bottom-left), Y up -> positive,
matching the gerbers (also exported --use-drill-file-origin).
