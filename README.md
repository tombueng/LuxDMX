### The RS485 Module: Waveshare TTL to RS485 (C)

This module is the key interface between the ESP32's UART and the DMX RS485 bus.

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Product name | Waveshare TTL to RS485 (C) |
| Isolation | Galvanic, 2500 V RMS (SP3485 + isolation transformer) |
| Direction control | Automatic — no DE/RE pin needed |
| TTL voltage | 3.3 V or 5 V (VCC selects level) |
| Max baudrate | ≥ 250 kbps (verified working at DMX rate) |
| Connector (TTL side) | 6-pin 2.54 mm header: VCC / GND / RXD / TXD / (unused) / (unused) |
| Connector (RS485 side) | Screw terminal: A / B / GND |
| Dimensions | ~38 × 14 mm |

> **Why galvanic isolation?**  
> DMX fixtures are often powered from separate circuits or have ground loops. The isolated module prevents ground noise from corrupting the signal and protects the ESP32 from voltage spikes.

> **Why auto-direction?**  
> Standard RS485 requires toggling a DE/RE pin to switch between transmit and receive. The Waveshare (C) variant handles this internally based on line activity — no GPIO needed, firmware is simpler. Trade-off: RDM (which requires half-duplex arbitration) is not supported by this module.

### Assembly Guide

#### Step 1 — Prepare the ESP32

No soldering required if using a DevKit with pre-soldered headers. Place it on a breadboard or in your enclosure.

#### Step 2 — Connect ESP32 ↔ RS485 module

Using dupont jumper wires:

| Color convention | From | To |
|---|---|---|
| Red | ESP32 **3.3V** | Module **VCC** |
| Black | ESP32 **GND** | Module **GND** |
| Yellow | ESP32 **GPIO17** | Module **TXD** |
| Green | ESP32 **GPIO16** | Module **RXD** |

> Use **3.3V**, not 5V — the ESP32's GPIOs are not 5V tolerant.

#### Step 3 — Wire the XLR connector

The DMX standard uses XLR-5 (5-pin), but most DMX fixtures also accept XLR-3. Pin numbering is the same:

| XLR Pin | Signal | RS485 module |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Shield / GND | Module GND (optional) |
| 2 | DMX Data– | Module **B** |
| 3 | DMX Data+ | Module **A** |
| 4 | (unused in DMX) | — |
| 5 | (unused in DMX) | — |

Screw the wires into the RS485 module's terminal block firmly.

#### Step 4 — Termination resistor (for longer cable runs)

For DMX cable runs over ~10 m, solder a **120 Ω resistor** between pins 2 and 3 (A and B) at the **far end** of the DMX chain (i.e., inside the last fixture's XLR input). Most professional fixtures include this internally.

#### Step 5 — Power

The ESP32 DevKit is powered via its **Micro-USB port**. Any 5V USB power supply works (500 mA is sufficient). The RS485 module draws its power from the ESP32's 3.3V rail.

---

### Notes

- **Do not connect DE/RE** — the Waveshare (C) handles direction automatically. Connecting them will break transmission.
- **Keep TTL wires short** (< 20 cm). Long unshielded wires on the TTL side pick up noise; the RS485 side handles long distances natively.
- **XLR gender:** Use a **female** XLR panel socket for the DMX output. DMX sources (transmitters) use female XLR; receivers use male XLR. LumiGate is a source.

## Flashing Pre-built Firmware

No toolchain needed. GitHub CI builds the firmware on every push to master.

**[Download latest release](https://github.com/tombueng/LumiGate/releases/tag/latest)** — includes `firmware.bin`, `bootloader.bin`, `partitions.bin`, `boot_app0.bin`.

### Boot mode (required for all methods)

This board has no auto-reset circuit, so you must enter download mode manually before flashing:

1. Unplug USB
2. Hold **BOOT** button on the ESP32
3. Plug USB back in (keep holding BOOT)
4. Release BOOT after ~1 second
5. Run the flash command — the LED stays off while in download mode

### Windows — one-liner (PowerShell)

Downloads and runs [`flash.ps1`](flash.ps1), which installs Python + esptool automatically:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process Bypass; irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tombueng/LumiGate/master/flash.ps1 | iex
```

Or save and run it manually:

```powershell
# Download
Invoke-WebRequest https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tombueng/LumiGate/master/flash.ps1 -OutFile flash.ps1
# Run
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process Bypass
.\flash.ps1
```

The script: installs Python 3 via `winget` if missing → installs `esptool` via pip → downloads the four firmware blobs from the latest GitHub release → lets you pick a COM port → guides you through boot mode → flashes.

### macOS / Linux

```bash
pip install esptool

REPO=tombueng/LumiGate
for f in firmware.bin bootloader.bin partitions.bin boot_app0.bin; do
  curl -sL "$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/$REPO/releases/tags/latest \
    | python3 -c "import sys,json; assets=json.load(sys.stdin)['assets']; \
      print(next(a['browser_download_url'] for a in assets if a['name']=='$f'))")" -o $f
done

# Put ESP32 in boot mode first (see above), then:
esptool.py --chip esp32 --port /dev/ttyUSB0 --baud 460800 \
  --before default_reset --after hard_reset \
  write_flash -z --flash_mode dio --flash_freq 80m \
  0x1000 bootloader.bin 0x8000 partitions.bin \
  0xe000 boot_app0.bin 0x10000 firmware.bin
```

> Replace `/dev/ttyUSB0` with your port (`/dev/tty.usbserial-*` on macOS).

## Build & Flash

### Requirements

- [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) with VS Code extension
- ESP32 connected via USB (CH340 or CP2102)

### Project Structure

```
LumiGate/
├── src/
│   ├── main.cpp          ← firmware logic only (~270 lines)
│   ├── pages/            ← edit web UI here (plain HTML)
│   │   ├── index.html
│   │   ├── config.html
│   │   ├── config_saved.html
│   │   ├── reset.html
│   │   └── reset_done.html
│   ├── assets/           ← images served by the ESP32
│   │   └── logo.png      ← 96×96 px, replaces itself on rebuild
│   └── generated/        ← auto-created at build time, gitignored
├── docs/                 ← documentation assets (README images)
├── extra_scripts.py      ← PlatformIO pre-build hook
└── platformio.ini
```

### How the build pipeline works

Before every `pio run`, PlatformIO executes `extra_scripts.py`, which:

1. Reads every `src/pages/*.html` file
2. Reads every `src/assets/*.png` file
3. Converts them to C `PROGMEM` arrays / string literals and writes them to `src/generated/*.h`
4. `main.cpp` `#include`s those headers — the HTML and images become part of the firmware binary

**To change the web UI**, edit the HTML files in `src/pages/` and rebuild — no C++ changes needed.  
**To replace the logo**, drop a new 96×96 PNG into `src/assets/logo.png` and rebuild.

Dynamic values (IP address, universe number, etc.) use `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` tokens in the HTML; `main.cpp` substitutes them at request time with `String::replace()`.

### First Flash (USB)

```bash
pio run --target upload
```

> **If upload fails** ("Wrong boot mode"): Hold **BOOT** button, tap **EN/RST**, release BOOT — chip enters download mode. Then retry upload.
>
> Or use the included flash helper:
> ```bash
> bash ~/.claude/flash_esp32.sh COM3 460800
> ```
> The script gives you an 8-second countdown to press BOOT+EN.

### OTA Updates (after first flash)

Uncomment in `platformio.ini`:
```ini
upload_protocol = espota
upload_port     = lumigate.local
upload_flags    = --auth=dmxota
```

---

## First Setup

### 1. Config Portal

On first boot (or after WiFi reset), LumiGate opens a WiFi access point:

- **SSID:** `DMX-Gateway` (no password)
- Connect with phone or PC → browser auto-opens portal (or go to `192.168.4.1`)
- Select your network, enter password, set Art-Net Universe (default: `0`)
- Click **Save** → LumiGate connects and reboots

### 2. Status Page

Open `http://lumigate.local` (or the IP shown in serial monitor at 115200 baud):

- Live stats: framerate, RSSI, uptime, free heap
- All 512 DMX channels as a color-coded grid (cyan = active)
- Click any cell → slider appears → set value directly

### 3. Changing WiFi / Config Reset

To move LumiGate to a different WiFi network, clear its stored credentials — it will reopen the setup portal on next boot.

| Method | Steps |
|---|---|
| **Web** (easiest) | Open `http://lumigate.local/reset` → click **Reset WiFi** → device reboots into AP mode |
| **Hardware** | Power off → hold **BOOT** → power on → keep holding for 3 seconds → release → device reboots into AP mode |

After reset, connect to the `DMX-Gateway` access point (no password) and follow the [First Setup](#1-config-portal) steps to join the new network.

## Web UI

| URL | Function |
|---|---|
| `/` | Live status + 512-channel DMX grid |
| `/config` | Change universe, hostname, OTA password |
| `/reset` | Clear WiFi credentials, reboot to AP mode |
| `/dmx.json` | JSON API: all 512 values, fps, rssi, uptime, heap |

### WebSocket (port 81)

Binary push frame at up to 25 fps:

```
Bytes  0–1   fps × 10        uint16 big-endian
Bytes  2–3   RSSI (dBm)      int16  big-endian
Bytes  4–7   free heap       uint32 big-endian
Bytes  8–11  uptime (s)      uint32 big-endian
Bytes 12–523 DMX ch 1–512   uint8[512]
```

Browser → ESP32 (JSON text):
```json
{ "type": "set",     "ch": 1,   "val": 200  }
{ "type": "mode",    "manual":  true         }
{ "type": "blackout"                         }
```

---

## QLC+ Setup

1. Open **Eingänge/Ausgänge** tab
2. Click in the output area right of **Universe 1** → select **ArtNet** → interface `192.168.x.x` (your PC's IP)
3. Configure: IP = LumiGate's IP, Art-Net Universe = `0`
4. Test with **Einfaches Mischpult** → move fader → grid lights up cyan

> **Universe mapping:** QLC+ "Universe 1" = Art-Net Universe `0`. LumiGate defaults to Universe `0`.

## Status LED (GPIO2 / D2)

| State | LED |
|---|---|
| No WiFi | Off |
| Connected, no Art-Net | Short pulse every 2 s (heartbeat) |
| Art-Net receiving | Solid on |

---

## Persistent Configuration (NVS)

| Key | Default | Change via |
|---|---|---|
| Art-Net Universe | `0` | Web `/config` or portal |
| Hostname | `dmx-gateway` | Web `/config` |
| OTA Password | `dmxota` | Web `/config` |
| WiFi credentials | — | Config portal or `/reset` |
